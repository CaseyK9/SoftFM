* write README.txt
* push to github
* implement WAV file writing
* implement stereo pilot PPS
* implement RDS decoding
* figure out why we sometimes lose stereo lock
* investigate problem at low IF sample rates; apparently librtlsdr is not telling the truth about the actual sample rate.
* look at I/Q balance to improve weak stations
* look at hardware gain settings to improve weak stations
* consider FM demodulation with PLL instead of phase discriminator
