-----------------------------------

Sample rates between 301000 Hz and 900000 Hz (inclusive) are not supported.
They cause an invalid configuration of the RTL chip.
  rsamp_ratio = 28.8 MHz * 2**22 / sample_rate
  If bit 27 and bit 28 of rsamp_ratio are different, the RTL chip malfunctions.

The RTL chip has a configurable 32-tap FIR filter.
RTL-SDR currently configures it for cutoff at 1.2 MHz (2.4 MS/s).

Casual test of ADC errors:
 * DC offset in order of 1 code step
 * I/Q gain mismatch in order of 4%
 * I/Q phase mismatch in order of 1% of sample interval
